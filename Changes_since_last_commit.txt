F
Few edits to TTS (Still not working, figure out how to send a response object and trigger a download dialog)
Major changes to the directory browser (Split into 4 parts). 
Icon buttons added for pdf, audio, video (Runs when working as a stand-alone html page, but not when the app is run as a whole)

G (1st july, 5 pm)
Restructured Directory, improved usage of S3 bucket (boto rather than boto3)
Added Upload capability to the app, for directory. Feature detects extension and places it in the right bucket automatically.
Added a mock 'forgotpassword' route
Added lang attribute in tabs according to WCAG 2.0

Further work left - Working out download capabilities for TTS and PDF viewer. Audio and video templates. Fusing JWT code into branch. Building the mock password route. More WCAG 2.0 implementation

NOTE: Since WCAG 2.0 is mostly front end stuff, not sure if I should mess around with the designing (dunno much of it)

Errors: Credential errors for FB/Twitter/LinkedIn/S3 Bucket, response not valid for mytts
