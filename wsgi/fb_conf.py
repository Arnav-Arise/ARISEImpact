'''How to get credentials for FB: create a Facebook App which will be used to access Facebook's Graph API. Go to Facebook Apps dashboard -> Click Add a New App -> Choose platform WWW -> Choose a new name for your app -> Click Create New Facebook App ID -> Create a New App ID -> ChooseCategory (I chose "Entertainment") -> Click Create App ID again. Go back to Apps dashboard -> Select the new app -> Settings -> Basic -> Enter Contact Email. This is required to take your app out of the sandbox. Go to Status & Review -> Do you want to make this app and all its live features available to the general public? -> Toggle the button to Yes -> Make App Public? -> Yes. This will enable others to see posts by your app in their timelines - otherwise, only you will see the wall posts by the app.  Make a note of the App ID and App Secret '''
